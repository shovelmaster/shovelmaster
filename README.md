# Shovelmaster: The Legacy

Legend says that we began with George Washington,
but the simple truth is that we were around long before his time.

When the pyramids were built, we were there.

Stonehenge. Maybe. Probably.

The point is, we're old.

And we're everywhere:

Among the curious

the young,

and the old.

or small,

through danger and turmoil,

we'll be there.

All Shovel Masters know this:

**It matters not where you
began, but only where the
path you make will take you.**
